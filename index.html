      <h1>Deep Sea Survival</h1>
      <h2>DESIGN LEAGUE TEAM</h2>
      <h2>By: Malachi, Syeda, Sheldon, & Michael</h2>

      <h3>Our Project</h3>
      <p>In our game, the player moves to collect trash. The player has to avoid the sharks and the fish. The player has to collect trash to survive and see how long they'll last.
</p>
      <h3>Our Inspiration</h3>
      <p>The ocean covers 71% percent of earth’s surface and it houses many critical resources! Global warming is causing this to become even higher percentage as high temperatures melt ice into our oceans. But guess what? There is 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic waste estimated to be in our oceans. Our game might teach you a little bit about helping the biggest portion of where we live. 
</p>
      <h3>Our Design Process</h3>
      <p>The idea of our game came after consultation with each other and decided we wanted an action filled survival game that also impressed on players about the methods of helping our oceans. We evolved our project through Figma, shown to the right, where we are able to use our visualization to plan how to make our project suitable As shown to the right, a rough mockup is made with all of our collaboration showing how we would like our game to appear. This will change quite a lot after our final phases.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Our project has incredible collaboration creating a game that strives to truly impact its users. It will inform users of  the basic ways to protect our oceans. Next time, we would’ve have put way more effort into the aesthetically pleasing aspects.
